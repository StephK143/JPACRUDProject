# Skill Distillery - Week 9: JPA Beaches Site

This is a dynamic web application that implements full CRUD with a data base I created in MySQL Workbench. It allows the user to search a database for beaches using either the beach ID or they can choose the beach from a list of all the beaches in the database. Once the full details of the beach are shown the user has the option to edit or delete the beach.The user can also choose to add new beaches.

A list of beaches showing name, description and the closet city to them has the link to view full details about the beach.

If the user chooses to edit the beach, the user is directed to a form with editable fields populated with the beaches's current data. 

The user can also choose to add new beaches.

At any time, the user may click the home icon to return to the main page.

#Lessons learned

This project was an introduction to JPA and creating databases with MySQL Workbench. The project has helped me understand request mapping, jpql queries, entity managers and to a higher degree. I still continue to learn more about the OOP, inheritance and collections with each project.
